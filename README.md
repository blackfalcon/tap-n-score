# BallDrop

As a challenge I was asked to design and build a game. I was given some basic specifications about the game to include:

* Create game of randomly dropped targets in various sizes
* Game must have a START and PAUSE function
* Game option is to have slider that adjusts speed of falling targets
* Once target is clicked/tapped, target is to respond and be removed from play
* Points are rewarded based on target size; the smaller the target, the more points
* Game should operate on mobile devise as well as desktop

To build the game, I used core web dev technologies of HTML/CSS/JS.

No design spec was given, so I thought it fun to use different sport balls as targets.

To get things rolling, I used jQuery, but as a stretch goal it would be good to replace all jQuery functions with ES6 code.

Sass was used to build the CSS. Common CSS used from Normalize and Boilerplate.

### Play the game

If you are interested, [you can see the game here](http://balldrop.anotheruiguy.com/)

It's a pretty simple game, I hope you enjoy.
